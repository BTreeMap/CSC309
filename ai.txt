Generative AI Usage Disclosure

In this project, Generative AI was utilized as an assistive tool for specific, supervised tasks. Its use was limited to:

- Assisting in the generation of test cases.
- Generating initial drafts of documentation.
- Aiding in the implementation of a subset of features. This was performed with detailed prompts and all output was subject to careful human review and validation.
- Producing translations for the frontend's internationalization (i18n) support for six languages.
